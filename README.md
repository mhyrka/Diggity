Diggity is a social networking app for dog lovers. It allows dog owners to create profiles for their pets
which they use to connect with other users nearby.

## **Getting Started**

To run - fork and clone this repo to your local machine. Make sure you either have Expo on your
phone, or xcode / android studio on your computer. From the terminal, navigate to the directory, "Diggity" and run `npm i` to install all dependencies. Then run `npm start`.

## **User Experience**

As a user you create a profile with an email and password. You can send a direct message to other nearby users or check out the map view to see who is around. You can also add friends to your network to
stay connected with your favorites.
